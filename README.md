**Project Overview**

This project analyzes a ramen dataset, focusing on various attributes such as brand, country, rating (stars), and salt content (percentage of salt). The goal is to uncover patterns and insights from the data, such as the top-performing ramen brands, the relationship between salt content and star ratings, and the distribution of ramen styles and packaging by country.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this case study contains information about different ramen brands, their ratings, packaging styles, and salt content across several countries. It also includes whether a ramen brand made it to the top 10 list for a given year.

**Libraries Used**

`ggplot2`: For data visualization.
`dplyr`: For data manipulation and grouping.
`tidyr`: For data cleaning (handling NA values).
`stringr`: For text processing and keyword matching.

**How to Run the Project**

Clone the repository and ensure the ramen.Rdata file is in the working directory.
Load the dataset using the provided load() function.
Ensure you have the necessary R libraries installed (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr).
Run the code chunks to perform the analysis and visualize the results.
